At the clothing store

Salesperson - Good morning, can I help you?
Customer - Yes, thank you. I saw a pair of black trousers in the window, can I try them on?
Salesperson - Of course, what size?
Customer - I wear a size 50.
Salesperson - Here they are!
Customer - Where are the fitting rooms?
Salesperson - The fitting rooms are down there on the right, next to the stairs.
Customer - Perfect, thank you.

Salesperson - How are they?
Customer - I like the style, but they're a bit tight. Can I try a larger size?
Salesperson - Oh, I'm sorry, we're out of size 52 in this color, would you like to try the same model in brown?
Customer - No, thank you, I really don't like brown. Don't you have other colors in this size?
Salesperson - Well, in size 52 we have brown, red, and gray.
Customer - Alright, I'll try them in gray, let's see how they fit.

Customer - I tried on the trousers, they are really nice in gray and the size is perfect! How much are they?
Salesperson - They cost â‚¬85.
Customer - Aren't they on sale?
Salesperson - Ah, no, I'm sorry, the sales are only on winter merchandise. These trousers are from the new summer collection.
Customer - That's a shame, they seem a bit expensive.
Salesperson - Look, it's 100% cotton, the quality of the material is excellent!
Customer - Can I pay with a credit card?
Salesperson - Of course, there are no problems, you can pay by card or cash.
Customer - Okay, then I'll take them, thank you very much for your help.
